For your eleventh programming assignment, you will be implementing a program that uses a linked list. You will be implementing the following structure and functions: struct LinkedList { int value; LinkedList *next; }; append_node: Appends a new node (created using the new statement) to the end of the linked list.insert_node: Inserts a new node (created using the new statement) at the specified location in the list.delete_node: Deletes a node from the specified location in the list search_node: searches the list for a value.destroy_list: At the end of the program, this function loops through the entire list and destroys the list by using the delete statement on each dynamically allocated linked list node (to avoid a memory leak). Note that with a singly linked list, you need to maintain a head pointer (pointer to the beginning of the list). Typically, a tail pointer (pointer to the end of the list) is not maintained in a singly linked list (because you can only iterate from the beginning to the end), although it can be.
